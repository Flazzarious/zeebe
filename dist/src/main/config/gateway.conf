# Zeebe standalone gateway configuration file, for the configuration of the embedded gateway
# see the gateway section of the application.conf

# Overview -------------------------------------------

# This file contains a complete list of available configuration options.

# Default values:
#
# When the default value is used for a configuration option, the option is
# commented out. You can learn the default value from this file

# Conventions:
#
# Byte sizes
# For buffers and others must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "10U" where U (unit) must be replaced with K = Kilobytes, M = Megabytes or G = Gigabytes.
# If unit is omitted then the default unit is simply bytes.
# Example:
# sendBufferSize = "16M" (creates a buffer of 16 Megabytes)
#
# Time units
# Timeouts, intervals, and the likes, must be specified as strings and follow the following
# format: "VU", where:
#   - V is a numerical value (e.g. 1, 1.2, 3.56, etc.)
#   - U is the unit, one of: ms = Millis, s = Seconds, m = Minutes, or h = Hours
#
# Paths:
# Relative paths are resolved relative to the installation directory of the
# broker.
